This assignment is a primer for 504/507.

The variables are x and y. x is an integer and y is a string. myList is a list of the letters from a to d. For the dictionary it contains at least 3 keys and includes at least one list and one nested dictionary.

The function is volumeChecker that takes in 2 inputs, waterIn and WaterOut. The function indicates if waterIn or waterOut is low or high with the baseline of 50. For instance, if waterIn is 10 then it is less than 50, which equals volumeIn is low and if waterOut is 20 then its less than 50 then the volumeOut is also low. The fillTank variable subtracts waterIn or waterOut from 200. With a waterIn of 10 "Add 190 gallons to fill tank." will be printed, while a waterOut of 20 "Remaining 180 gallons in tank.' will be printed. Additional printouts include volumeIn is: 10 gallons, volumeIn is: low, volumeOut is: 20 gallons and volumeOut is: low.
